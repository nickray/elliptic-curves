/// This curve is also known as prime256v1 (ANSI X9.62) and secp256r1 (SECG)
/// and is specified in FIPS 186-4: Digital Signature Standard (DSS):

/// <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf>
///
/// It's included in the US National Security Agency's "Suite B" and is widely
/// used in protocols like TLS and the associated X.509 PKI.
///
/// Its equation is `y² = x³ - 3x + b` over a ~256-bit prime field where `b` is
/// the "verifiably random"† constant:
///
/// ```text
